 Project simulates a data center containing five virtual machines running Ubuntu22.04 Linux distribution. The setup includes DNS server, two web servers and two servers that represent a database cluster. <br> 
 
 **DNS server** is configured with bind9 service, where I achieved translation of IP addresses to a domain names for two web sites that are hosted on a same web server. DNS server contains a zones configured for both web sites. <br>
 
 On **web servers** I  configured Apache2 Virtual Hosting service. Virtual hosting is a solution for hosting multiple web sites on a same server, what I achieved. At the application layer I installed **WordPress software** and configured WordPress admins for both web sites. WordPress web sites are connected with database cluster with **MySQL client**. <br>
 
 For a database I chose to configure **Percona Xtradb Cluster** - High Availability Solution for MySQL. What I achieved here is  master and slave server synchronized to work as one. The entire cluster has a virtual IP address that is configured with keepalived service. Communication between servers in a cluster is encrypted. <br>
 
 So, why we need two web servers? My plan is  to make a web application that moves whole configuration from one server to another if one server is attacked. This is left for future implementation. The entire configuration is automated with python scripts, so if there is a need for changing some basic parameters as domain name, IP address, database name etc. I donâ€™t need to do it in every single file manually. 

// /etc/ansible/hosts-> all hosts in this file
// ssh-copy-id -i vagrant.ed25519 vagrant@IP //kopira public key ovog private key-a koji imamo na nasem hostu i bitno je jako da je to ovaj kljuc, jer je on u /etc/ansible.hosts fajlu !!!
// ansible-playbook -i /etc/ansible/hosts slaveEnd.yml --limit pxc_slave_node

//sve ip adrese iz promenljivih iz baze se moraju ispraviti da odgovaraju pravim ip adresama web servera

//sa wordpress servera se logujem na bazu:
> mysql -h 192.168.56.18 -u wordpress_user -p
>
> redosled: 1 dns, 2 baza, 3 web server. ne menjati ip adrese ako ne moras bas...
> provera: mysql -u root -p; show databases; use mysql; show tables; select User from user; //users added
>  mysql -u root -p; show databases; ''wp1 i 2
> wget http://webSiteOne.domain.ca FROM DNS, NOT FROM BROWSER (we want the same subnet)
